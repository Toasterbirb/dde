# dde
dde (dynamic desktop environment) is a collection of different programs creating a simple desktop environment. How is this different from Gnome or KDE etc. you might ask. Not too much and a lot at the same time. When someone chooses to go with a window manager only setup instead of a readymade desktop environment, they are basically building their own desktop environment by combining different programs.

## Features and programs
The list is still short, but it doesn't necessarily need to be even that long to have a working system. Things are going to be added as needed.
